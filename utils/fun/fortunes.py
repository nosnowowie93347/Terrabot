    "\nThe truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only\nopposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts\nat rational thinking. Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of\nknowledge a serpent ― slimy, sneaking and abominable. Since the earliest\ndays the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every\neffort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and\neverywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad\nlaws, bad social theories, bad institutions.

    "\nWhen a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of\nsense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that\nthey are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save\nthe most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and\nwhose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted,\nthe candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on\nthe man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can\nmost adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The\nPresidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected,\nthe office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We\nmove toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of\nthe land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be\nadorned by a downright moron.\n        ― H. L. Mencken\n",
